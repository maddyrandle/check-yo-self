# Check Yo'Self
Check Yo'Self is the last solo project for Front End Module 1 at the Turing School of Software & Design. The goal was to build an application where users can create to-do lists and mark tasks off as they're completed. Users can enter a title for each list and mark its urgency. There is a search function that allows users to search for a specific list quickly. This project focuses on practice writing DRY JavaScript, persisting data, iterating/filtering through DOM elements using for loops, and understanding the relationship between the data model and displaying data on the DOM. 

## Learning Goals
* Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  * DRY JavaScript
  * localStorage to persist data
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
